___________________________________________________________________________
A group of maximum three (03) students can work on this assignment together 
and make one final group report, each student needs to submit a copy of their 
group report.  The assignment consists of 3 parts that need to be submitted as one report.

# Description:
    Trendy Gifts is a shop that sells various gift items. They want to promote their 
    business by selling their products online. A part of the software requirement is 
    given below. You are required to do additional self-study on how online shopping 
    websites function and create a design for managing it.
 
# Requirements
    The items being sold in the shop are mainly of three types, 
    Money Card, Dubai gifts, and Arabic Sweets. All relevant details of these 
    items are stored in the system including a unique ID, item description, the price, 
    and available quantity in the store. At any point in time, the system is able to 
    generate reports to show the stock of the available items, the description of each item. Many people visit the website, 
    but if an online purchase has to be made the visitor has to register with the website. 
    This requires the person to give some personal details and also furnish an email-id, 
    username and password. After a successful login, the online customer can populate a 
    shopping-cart from the list of all available items in the online shop. Each customer 
    also has an account which tracks the total amount to be paid for the selected items in 
    the shopping-cart. Once the customer checks-out, a total-bill is issued for the customer’s 
    order and the payment is accepted using a valid credit card. Details of successful 
    transactions are maintained in the customer’s account.
